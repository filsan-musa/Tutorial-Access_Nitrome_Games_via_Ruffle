# Nitrome Flash Games: Run using Ruffle

With websites like Nitrome and Miniclip once dominating the online entertainment scape, web games are slowly fading into history. In the age of smartphones and tablets, mobile gaming has surged ahead, reshaping most online titles into touch-based app experiences rather than the keyboard-driven web adventures of the past. This transformation resulted in the retirement of Flash, as companies saw little reason to maintain it while player numbers on traditional gaming sites dwindled.

While it is sad to see that era fade, I wanted to share a little piece of my own online gaming joy: spending evenings on the family PC, playing Square Meal, Jack Frost, Bad Ice Cream or some other Nitrome game after finishing my homework. This guide is a fun tutorial for those feeling nostalgic for the days of browser gaming. So, letâ€™s dust off those memories and get started.
